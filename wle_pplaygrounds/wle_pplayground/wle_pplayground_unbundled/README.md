# Overview

A collection of playground template projects for the [Wonderland Engine](https://wonderlandengine.com/).

The projects include the [PP library](https://github.com/signorpipo/wle-pp).

If u prefer to start with a default template project that uses the PP library, you can use the [PPefault template](https://github.com/signorpipo/wle-ppefault) instead.

A collection of assets that can be useful while working with the Wonderland Engine (like gamepads 3D models) can be found [here](https://github.com/signorpipo/wle-assets).

The development of this template and the PP library is actually being done on the [wle-pp-dev](https://github.com/signorpipo/wle-pp-dev) repository, where you can find the most up to date version of the library, even though it might not be stable.

## Playgrounds Versions

Every playground template usually comes in three versions:
- standard
  - the PP library is included as an `npm` package
- unbundled
  - the PP library is not included as an `npm` package, but as files in the project
  - can be useful if u plan to edit the PP library to adjust them to your need
- pipo
  - a specific version made for myself
  - it is based on the unbundled version plus some extras like the PWA support

## PPlayground

[Live Version](https://signorpipo.itch.io/pplayground-wonderland-engine)

The main playground.

Some of the PP features u will find in this playground are:
- ppefault setup
- player locomotion
- grab & throw
- virtual gamepad

Some of the custom features u will find in this playground are:
- background music
- sfx for the grab & throw and other interactions
- particles
- grabbable objects spawner
- a bit of gameplay logic to check when u have hit the flying target

Every custom component or object that is not strictly needed has been added under the `Playground` object inside the scene, so you can safely remove it.  
This is also true for every custom scripts, which can be found in the `playground` folder.

### Things To Know

When using this template, there are certain things to take into consideration:
  - if u change the structure of the `Player` object, some features might not work properly anymore
  - inside the `app.ts` file of the `wle-pplayground` template, the following line is added to make type extensions available to typescript
    - `import "wle-pp/add_type_extensions_to_typescript.js";`
    - if u delete the `src.ts` file and auto generate it again, type extensions might cause type errors until you add this line back manually
